- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I get my hands on
- 🏢 I'm working on network security and automation
- 👯 I’m looking to expand my knowledge on [Golang](https://adyanth.site/tags/golang/) and [K8s](https://adyanth.site/tags/kubernetes/)
- 🥅 2022 Goals: Contribute more to open source projects, document as much as possible
